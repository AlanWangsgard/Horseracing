# Overview

I used this project as a base for learning Java and further my understanding of programming languages.

This project simulates Horse racing. The player can add horses, place bets, and win in game money, or lose in game money.

The purpose of this was to create something with java that would requre me to learn and apply the java syntax and tools.
